# Machine-Learning
My machine learning notes &amp; projects. All my code are using python 3.

The folders are organized as follows. Each topic or method has a separate folder. Within that folder there are 3 sub-folders:

  1) Theory.
  2) Code - From Theory.
  3) Code - From an API(Scikit-learn, Tensorflow etc.).
  
# Theory:
This folder usually contains jupyter notebook(s) that has my notes on that specific algorithm:
  1) What is the algorithm? How does it work?
  2) Mathematical foundations.
  3) How to build a model?
  4) How to evaluate the model?
  5) How to improve the model?
  6) Advantages/ Disadvantages of this algorithm.
  
I usually provide references for the all the material I used here (Books, Lecture notes, Blogs etc.)
  
# Code - From Theory:
This folder contains python code for that algorithm:
 1) This code is the implementation of the theory described above.
 2) Also contains some generic fucntions associated with that algorithm.
 3) A sample project including a dataset whenever applicable.
 
Each code at the beginning describes what the code accomplishes, sub-functions list/usage, dataset used etc.
 
# Code - From an API(ML):
This folder contains python code for that algorithm built using an API. 
Some of the ML APIs I used:
 1) Scikit-learn.
 2) Tensorflow.
 3) Keras.
 4) Theano.
  
# Competitions:
This folder contains projects from any competitions that I participate.
  
# Misc:
Other than this there might be other files that contains information about general machine learning. Some of the topics include:
 1) How to choose an algorithm for a problem?
 2) Algorithm efficieny.
 3) Feature selection/ Feature Engineering.
 4) Common mistakes & how to avoid them?
 5) SQL topics.
 6) Data visualization topics.
 7) Big data.

And much more...
 
Please hit me up if you find any errors or have any questions. Happy learning!
